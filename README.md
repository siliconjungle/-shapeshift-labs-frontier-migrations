# @shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations

Boundary-first data migration, import normalization, and plugin/API version mapping primitives for Frontier state. The package keeps compatibility logic at the data-ingress edge so application code, renderers, caches, CRDT documents, and game systems consume the current shape.

- npm: [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations)
- source: [`siliconjungle/-shapeshift-labs-frontier-migrations`](https://github.com/siliconjungle/-shapeshift-labs-frontier-migrations)

## API Shape

```ts
import {
  createDefaultValueMigration,
  createMigrationRegistry,
  createPathMoveMigration,
  createPluginAdapter,
  createVersionedEnvelope,
  inspectMigrationRegistry
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations';

const migrations = createMigrationRegistry({
  id: 'app-state',
  currentVersion: '3',
  migrations: [
    createPathMoveMigration({
      id: 'todo.title',
      from: '1',
      to: '2',
      read: '/todos/0/text',
      write: '/todos/0/title'
    }),
    createDefaultValueMigration({
      id: 'todo.done',
      from: '2',
      to: '3',
      path: '/todos/0/done',
      value: false
    })
  ]
});

const inbound = createVersionedEnvelope('1', {
  todos: [{ id: 'a', text: 'Ship migrations' }]
});

const { data, report } = migrations.migrate(inbound, {
  source: 'idb:app-state',
  actor: 'local-user'
});

// Application state only sees the current shape.
state.commit(data);
console.log(report.steps.map((step) => step.id));

const pluginAdapter = createPluginAdapter({
  plugin: 'calendar',
  api: 'v1',
  registry: migrations,
  mapInput(payload) {
    return {
      $version: '1',
      todos: [{ id: payload.id, text: payload.label }]
    };
  }
});

const currentPayload = pluginAdapter.map({ id: 'plugin:1', label: 'Import me' });
```

## Graph Diagnostics

Registries expose a serializable migration graph so CI, devtools, Playwright/AI probes, and release scripts can inspect the same version topology that runtime planning uses.

```ts
const graph = migrations.inspect();

console.log(graph.rootVersions);
console.log(graph.headVersions);
console.log(graph.issues);

// Tooling can inspect a registry definition without constructing a runtime boundary.
const status = inspectMigrationRegistry({
  id: 'plugin-api',
  currentVersion: '3',
  initialVersion: '1',
  migrations: [
    createPathMoveMigration({ id: 'plugin.v1-v2', from: '1', to: '2', read: '/label', write: '/title' }),
    createDefaultValueMigration({ id: 'plugin.v2-v3', from: '2', to: '3', path: '/enabled', value: true })
  ]
});
```

The graph reports duplicate migration ids, duplicate steps, cycles, unreachable targets, wildcard steps, multiple heads, and dead-end heads. Runtime registries reject error-level graph issues up front; warning-level issues remain inspectable for staged plugin/API import paths.

## DOM Snapshot And Compiled UI Migration

`frontier-migrations` also handles serialized renderer artifacts without depending on `frontier-dom`. DOM wire versions stay untouched; app/UI data versions live in `source.dataVersion`, `manifest.source.dataVersion`, or an explicit migration artifact wrapper.

```ts
import {
  createMigrationArtifact,
  createMigrationRegistry,
  createPathMoveMigration,
  migrateArtifact,
  migrateDomCompiledView,
  migrateDomSerializedState
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations';

const uiMigrations = createMigrationRegistry({
  id: 'todo-ui',
  currentVersion: 'ui@2',
  migrations: [
    createPathMoveMigration({
      id: 'snapshot.todo-title',
      from: 'ui@1',
      to: 'ui@2',
      read: '/snapshot/todos/0/text',
      write: '/snapshot/todos/0/title'
    })
  ]
});

const migratedState = migrateDomSerializedState(uiMigrations, serializedDomState);
app.hydrate(migratedState.data);

const migratedCompiledView = migrateDomCompiledView(uiMigrations, compiledView, {
  dataVersionPaths: ['/manifest/source/dataVersion']
});
app.hydrate(migratedCompiledView.data);

const artifact = createMigrationArtifact('frontier.dom.compiled', 'ui@1', compiledView);
const migratedArtifact = migrateArtifact(uiMigrations, artifact);
```

This makes UI-state versioning the same boundary workflow as database snapshots, plugin payloads, CRDT/server snapshots, and cached app state: import old data, migrate once, then let the app and renderer consume only the current shape.

## Syncable State And Replay Logs

The same registry can migrate syncable containers while preserving heads, state vectors, updates, and replay metadata.

```ts
import {
  createPatchPathRewriteRule,
  migrateCrdtSnapshot,
  migrateEventLogSnapshot,
  migrateStateCacheSnapshot,
  migrateSyncableSnapshot
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations';

const stateMigrations = createMigrationRegistry({
  id: 'todo-state',
  currentVersion: '2',
  migrations: [
    createPathMoveMigration({
      id: 'todo.title',
      from: '1',
      to: '2',
      read: '/todos/0/text',
      write: '/todos/0/title'
    })
  ]
});

const migratedSync = migrateSyncableSnapshot(stateMigrations, {
  basis: { dataVersion: '1', heads, stateVector },
  snapshot: { todos: [{ id: 'a', text: 'Migrate me' }] }
});

const migratedCrdt = migrateCrdtSnapshot(stateMigrations, crdtSnapshot);
const migratedCache = migrateStateCacheSnapshot(cacheMigrations, cache.extract());

const pathRule = createPatchPathRewriteRule('/todos', '/tasks', { prefix: true });
const migratedLog = migrateEventLogSnapshot(stateMigrations, eventLogSnapshot, {
  patchPathRules: [pathRule]
});
```

`migrateSnapshotPayload(...)` is the generic primitive behind those helpers. It migrates one payload path inside a larger object, writes the current data version back to the container, and can append an inspectable migration history entry. The CRDT/sync/cache/event-log helpers only choose structural defaults:

- sync snapshots: `/snapshot`, `/state`, `/view`, `/data`, or `/cache`
- CRDT snapshots: `/view` first, then snapshot/state/data fallbacks
- state-cache snapshots: root payload, because `entities` and `queries` are the durable cache shape
- event-log snapshots: snapshot payload plus optional patch-path rewrites for replay records

## Runtime Data Sources

Apps and framework builds can wrap old data sources with one runtime migrator instead of hand-picking helpers at every hydration call site.

```ts
import { createRuntimeDataMigrator } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations';

const runtimeMigrations = createRuntimeDataMigrator(stateMigrations, {
  targetVersion: '2'
});

const appState = runtimeMigrations.migrate(rawStateFromIndexedDb, {
  kind: 'state',
  sourceId: 'idb:app-state',
  versionPath: '/$version'
});

const cacheSource = runtimeMigrations.source({
  id: 'query-cache',
  kind: 'query-cache',
  read: () => storage.load(),
  write: (snapshot) => storage.save(snapshot)
});

await cacheSource.load();
```

`migrateRuntimeData(...)` and `createRuntimeDataMigrator(...)` dispatch to the state, sync snapshot, CRDT snapshot, query-cache/state-cache, event-log, DOM state, DOM compiled view, DOM manifest, or artifact helper based on the declared source kind. The result shape is intentionally structural (`data`, `version`, `changed`, `report`, `envelope`, and optional `payloadPath`) so `frontier-state`, `frontier-state-cache`, adapters, devtools, agents, and framework-generated bridges can consume it without introducing reverse package dependencies.

## Design Notes

`frontier-migrations` deliberately owns the import boundary, not long-lived backwards-compatible app branches.

- The app runtime should operate on current data only.
- Importers can read raw database snapshots, CRDT/server snapshots, local cache payloads, plugin payloads, third-party API payloads, fixture files, serialized DOM state, compiled DOM views, and render manifests.
- `createMigrationRegistry(...)` plans deterministic version paths and throws on missing, cyclic, or ambiguous chains.
- `registry.inspect()` and `inspectMigrationRegistry(...)` expose Django/Alembic-style graph diagnostics for branch, head, cycle, wildcard, and unreachable-version checks.
- `migrate(...)` is sync and allocation-light for local storage and plugin adapters.
- `migrateAsync(...)` supports async migration steps for boundary work that must consult external data.
- `createVersionedEnvelope(...)` keeps durable snapshots self-describing without forcing a particular database schema.
- `createMigrationArtifact(...)` keeps compiled renderer artifacts and other non-state payloads self-describing when their native format has its own wire-format version.
- `migrateDomSerializedState(...)`, `migrateDomCompiledView(...)`, and `migrateDomRenderManifest(...)` are structural helpers; they do not import `frontier-dom` and they preserve DOM `version`/manifest `version` fields.
- `migrateSyncableSnapshot(...)`, `migrateCrdtSnapshot(...)`, `migrateStateCacheSnapshot(...)`, and `migrateEventLogSnapshot(...)` keep sync metadata intact while migrating the materialized payload to the current app shape.
- `migrateRuntimeData(...)` and `createRuntimeDataMigrator(...)` provide a single app/runtime entry point for old persisted state, query-cache snapshots, CRDT snapshots, event-log snapshots, DOM state, plugin data, and custom sources.
- `rewritePatchPaths(...)` and `createPatchPathRewriteRule(...)` update Frontier patch/event-log path references when a schema migration moves a subtree.
- `versionPath`, `getVersion`, and `setVersion` let state-cache, SQL, IndexedDB, file, CRDT, event-log, and server importers keep version metadata wherever their storage contract needs it.
- `validate(...)` is structural, so `frontier-schema` or application validators can check old and current shapes without becoming package dependencies.
- Reports include source/plugin/API/actor metadata, exact steps, checksums, reads, writes, warnings, dry-run state, and timings for logging, event replay, Playwright/AI probes, and devtools.
- Plugin adapters treat external API shape mapping as the same boundary workflow as stored-state migration.

## Install

```sh
npm install @shapeshift-labs/frontier-migrations
```

## Benchmarks

These are Frontier-only package measurements, not competitor comparisons.

Run package-local measurements:

```sh
npm run bench
```

The benchmark covers deterministic path planning, explain-only reports, small-object migration, versioned-envelope migration, dry-run migration, serialized DOM state migration, compiled DOM view migration, artifact-wrapper migration, syncable snapshot migration, runtime data-source migration dispatch, patch-path rewriting, and a repeated batch import fixture.
